# flight_delay
Predictor if a US flight will suffer a delay

## Problem statement
Some type of delay affects one third of US flights. About 2% of flights are also cancelled
Dela

## Solution proposed
Models can be build to try to predict if a flight will be delayed or not and by how much

## Models tested, 
Classifiers for whether delays are expected, and separate Regressor for minutes of delay
 ### AdaBoosting
 ### RandomForest
 ### GradientBoosting

## Next Steps:
 Code should be reduced to functions, but testing with differen parameters, datasets and including stacking should be done to imrove performance.
